GLOverlayUI
===========

**GLOverlayUI** is a desktop application that demonstrates the integration of a real-time OpenGL rendering pipeline with a native wxWidgets GUI.

It features an interactive 2D scene rendered on a ``wxGLCanvas``, including a clickable OpenGL overlay and a dynamic control panel using native UI widgets.

The Project is available `HERE! <https://github.com/Jukoo/GLOverlayUI->`_ 

Features
--------

- ‚úÖ OpenGL-powered 2D scene rendered on ``wxGLCanvas``
- üéØ Clickable UI overlay (PNG icon) rendered directly in OpenGL
- üìå Toggleable right-side control panel with:
  -  Using Mouse motion to control object  rotation [Feature] 
  - ``wxSlider`` to control object rotation or scale
  - ``wxCheckBox`` to toggle visibility of scene objects

- üßº Clean separation between rendering engine and UI logic
- üîÅ Real-time interaction between OpenGL scene and native UI


Dependencies
------------

- wxWidgets (GUI framework)
- OpenGL (GL/GLU for 2D rendering)
- CMake ‚â• 3.11

.. note::

   PNG loading is handled via ``wxImage`` and 'wxIcon' ‚Äì no external image library is required.
   The Rendering 2D Object is made by using OpenGL Rendering   Pipeline
